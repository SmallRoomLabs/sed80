# sed80 - Screen EDitor for Z80 CP/M 2.2

## _Please note that this is still very early work-in-progress_

### What

Since I can't find a small and easy-to-use fullscreen text editor that
supports VT100 and the arrow keys I'll attempt to write one myself.

It is about 30 years since I wrote any real Z80 code so this will most
likey be a long painful re-learning curve.
